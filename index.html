<h1 class="tc ttu">Neuron</h1>

<h3>Neuron be simple. Neuron be quick. Neuron makes markup epic and slick.</h3>

<p>Neuron is a powerful and intelligent markup language for writing a better world. Writing Neuron code is easy and fun, the syntax makes sense and doesn&#8217;t use extremely awkward keys, and your pages now load faster then your nerve impulses! Neuron has been engineered to help the simplest of people markup pages in a flash.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="tc">Smart and Friendly</h2>

<p>Neurone is now kinder than ever! <a href="docs.html#device-queries">Device-based Queries</a> make it so that only certain code is served to the specific device. This means that you get what you want on a device without having to sit through countless, precious hours of loading time for all the responsiveness to load and the page to format properly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="tc">Bloat is on a different boat</h2>

<p>Neuron knows that you love modularity. It also know that some times, not all code is used. That&#8217;s why Neuron now takes only what it needs from your <a href="docs.html#importing">imports</a> and leaves back all the bloat. It&#8217;s like when you&#8217;re flying - you don&#8217;t want to have any extra, unnecessary weight, because if you do, you&#8217;ll be stuck at the baggage check in for quiet a while.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="tc">No more tax in syntax</h2>

<p>Neuron is taking the tax out of syntax. It comes with to different styles for syntax that each provide benefits. There&#8217;s the <a href="docs.html#block-syntax">block syntax</a> which provides layout of the page and the <a href="docs.html#modifier-syntax">modifier syntax</a> which modifies elements in your page to make it look better. Put these together and you have a recipe for having fun writing pages while still enhancing then for the best viewing.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="tc">Mixins*</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you just have to <code>let</code> something take some value. Neuron comes with a cool feature that is missing in more traditional markup languages: <a href="docs.html#mixins">mixins</a>. You can define mixins anywhere in your page and then include those mixins in multiple places across your page and Neuron will render the, as other elements in your page.</p>

<hr />

<h2 class="tc">Open Source*</h2>

<p>Neuron is still being made better and firm. Think of it as a baby&#8217;s brain in its infancy. Once there is a better foundation for Neuron, you can expect it to be open sourced. Meanwhile, check out some of VWAS Studios&#8217; other open source projects on <a href="http://GitHub.com/VWAS/">GitHub</a>.</p>
